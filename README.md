# Halo-Merger-Tree
The software uses the Press-Schechter formalism to create a binary merger tree that creates halos larger than a critical/minimum mass at any particular redshift input by the user.

# Required Libraries
In order to run the software, the user needs to have the required python libraries- Numpy, Scipy, TQDM, Tkinter, CustomTKinter etc..
in case of any error related to python library, please install additional required libraries mentioned in the error.

#Running the software
Start by executing the python file halo.py. This will run the GUI.
To create the halos, please click on the halo guide button inside the GUI. This will open a readme file which will explain step-by-step process to start creating halos.

#Note
Currently the software is under development, although the halo creation works, I am planning to add a feature to assign black holes to each of the halo in the merger history.
The algorithm of this is ready and the user will be able to backtrack the halos and black holes throughout the mergertree. I just need to add a GUI for the black holes allocation part.

In the next updates, this feature will be available including a proper readme file explaining the algorithm and the information on parameters. 
User could also include a mass-loss due to gravitational waves in the merger of each black hole.

Finally, in the future updates, I am planning to add a visualization tool to help visualize the black holes and the halos which could be used to compare with the Press-Schecter Mass function, black hole - halo mass relation etc.

For any other requests, please write to me directly and I can consider adding it to the software.
